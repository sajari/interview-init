# interview-init

This is a reasonable starting place for the Sajari coding test. 

Candidates may pull in a package or three if they feel the need. Our advice is to move forward using just javascript. So long as they run in latest Chrome they should have access to most modern javascript APIs that they may want (native promises and fetch APIs) and none of these challenges require any heavy lifting from libraries.

/vanilla — If you're accustomed to JavaScript
/typescript — If you'd prefer to interview in TS.
