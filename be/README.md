# JavaScript Backend coding exercise

## Introduction

First things first, relax ... you are ***not*** going to find any trick questions here. 

The goal of this coding exercise is to see how you break down a problem and solve a relatively
known problem space, hopefully something you have seen or used before in your day-to-day work.

We want you to implement a cache, we will first start simple and then add some specific semantics as we go.

The code already has two high level interfaces `Fetcher` and `Entity`, a basic in-memory implementation
of a `Fetcher`, `FetcherInMemory` and an unimplemented `FetcherCache`.

Have a look through these classes and the current tests.

## Building

This project uses Gradle, if you are not familar with this build tool, do not worry ... this isn't a test about build tools!

## Questions

Provided during the interview.
